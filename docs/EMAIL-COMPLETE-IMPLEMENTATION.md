## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Add to `.env`:

```bash
# Email Service (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY="re_hSpE9HMA_QGB1gvEtNtApExNYqCxy9o7g"
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="hello@maula.tech"

## 🎯 Template Variables

Templates support variable replacement using `{{variable}}` syntax:

Available variables:
- `{{company_name}}` or `{{business_name}}` - Lead name
- `{{address}}` - Lead address
- `{{category}}` - Business category
- `{{phone}}` - Phone number
- `{{email}}` - Email address

Example template:
```
Subject: Quick question about {{company_name}}

Hi there!

I noticed {{company_name}} is a {{category}} business at {{address}}.

I'd love to chat about how we can help grow your business.

Best regards
```

## 🔄 Email Sequences

### How They Work

1. **Create Templates** - Define email templates with variables
2. **Create Sequence** - Chain templates with day delays and conditions
3. **Enroll Lead** - Add lead to sequence
4. **Auto Process** - Cron job checks due steps and sends emails

### Sequence Conditions

- `always` - Send regardless of previous email engagement
- `not_opened` - Only send if previous email wasn't opened
- `opened_no_reply` - Only send if previous email was opened but no reply
- `not_replied` - Only send if previous email had no reply

### Example Sequence

```json
{
  "name": "Cold Outreach Sequence",
  "steps": [
    {
      "day": 0,
      "templateId": "initial-outreach-template-id",
      "condition": "always"
    },
    {
      "day": 3,
      "templateId": "follow-up-1-template-id",
      "condition": "not_opened"
    },
    {
      "day": 7,
      "templateId": "follow-up-2-template-id",
      "condition": "opened_no_reply"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:**
- Day 0: Initial email sent immediately
- Day 3: If not opened, send follow-up 1
- Day 7: If opened but no reply, send follow-up 2

## 📊 Email Analytics

### Tracked Metrics (per email)

- ✅ Sent timestamp
- ✅ Delivery status (sent/delivered/bounced/failed)
- ✅ Opened timestamp
- ✅ Clicked timestamp
- ✅ Replied timestamp (webhook-ready)

### UI Display

Email history shows:
- Subject line
- Recipient email
- Status badge (color-coded)
- Sent date/time
- ✓ Opened indicator (if opened)
- ✓ Clicked indicator (if clicked)

### Pipeline Integration

When email is opened → Lead auto-moves to "Engaged" pipeline stage

## 🔗 Resend Webhook Setup

1. **Get webhook URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/resend`

2. **Configure in Resend dashboard**:
   - Go to https://resend.com/webhooks
   - Add new webhook endpoint
   - Enter webhook URL
   - Select events:
     - email.sent
     - email.delivered
     - email.opened
     - email.clicked
     - email.bounced

3. **Test webhook**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/resend \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "type": "email.opened",
       "data": {
         "email_id": "test-email-id",
         "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
       }
     }'
   ```

## 🕐 Cron Jobs

### Email Scheduler

File: `apps/workers/src/cron/email-scheduler.ts`

**Runs every hour** to:
1. Process scheduled emails (send emails with `scheduledFor <= now`)
2. Process sequence steps (check enrollments and send due emails)

**Setup:**
```bash
# In workers process
import './cron/email-scheduler';
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Send Test Email

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/leads/{leadId}/send-email?workspaceId={workspaceId}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "toEmail": "test@example.com",
    "subject": "Test Email",
    "body": "This is a test email from the system."
  }'
```

### Create Test Template

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/email/templates?workspaceId={workspaceId}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Template",
    "subject": "Hello {{company_name}}",
    "body": "We noticed your {{category}} business...",
    "variables": ["company_name", "category"]
  }'
```

### Batch Send Test

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/email/templates/batch-send?workspaceId={workspaceId}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "leadIds": ["lead-uuid-1", "lead-uuid-2"],
    "subject": "Test Batch",
    "body": "Batch email content"
  }'
```

## 💡 Usage Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Always verify domain** in Resend before sending production emails
2. **Test templates** with render endpoint before using in sequences
3. **Monitor webhook logs** for delivery issues
4. **Use conditions wisely** - Don't spam leads who aren't engaging
5. **Keep sequences short** - 3-5 emails max
6. **Track metrics** - Monitor open/click rates to optimize

### Common Pitfalls

❌ **Don't:**
- Send without verified domain (emails will fail)
- Use generic templates (low engagement)
- Ignore bounce rates (damages sender reputation)
- Send too frequently (leads to unsubscribes)

✅ **Do:**
- Personalize every email
- A/B test subject lines
- Respect engagement signals
- Monitor analytics regularly
